# Minecraft Legacy Console Edition Minigames Server
This is my recreation of the Minigames from Minecraft LCE. I based it off of my version of the game which comes from the WiiU, which you can find my dump here: https://github.com/BoomBoomMushroom/MinecraftWiiUDump
I was inspired by [Legacy Edition Minigames](https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/Minigames) and some videos on YouTube which brought me nostalgia and a desire to recreate that nostalgia the with my friends on a server.
